> sorry I could not develop this library again because I already resigned from where I work and I do not have attendance machine to develop this library

## Getting started

Login as admin to attendance machine and set the ip address for example (to 192.168.0.201) and connect the machine with ethernet to your network.

Connect to the machine

```python
import sys
import zklib
import time
import zkconst

zk = zklib.ZKLib("192.168.0.201", 4370)
ret = zk.connect()
print "connection:", ret
```

If result was
```
connection True
```
Then you are connected.
